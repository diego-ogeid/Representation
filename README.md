# Representation

Chemical Space Representation

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for representing chemical spaces using various Python libraries such as rdkit, py3Dmol, nablachem, and networkx.
Project Overview

The notebook demonstrates how to: 

    Leverage the nablachem library to create and explore chemical search spaces.
    Represent molecules in 2D and 3D using RDKit and Py3DMol.
    Generate graph representations of chemical structures using NetworkX.
   

Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to install the following Python packages:

    rdkit
    py3Dmol
    networkx
    matplotlib
    nablachem

You can install these packages via pip:

bash

pip install rdkit py3Dmol networkx matplotlib nablachem

Getting Started

    Clone the repository:

bash

git clone git@github.com:diego-ogeid/Representation.git

    Navigate to the directory:

bash

cd poster

    Open the notebook:

bash

jupyter notebook chemical_space_representation.ipynb

    Follow the instructions within the notebook to visualize molecular representations and explore chemical spaces.

Usage

    2D and 3D Molecular Representations: Visualize molecules using RDKit and Py3DMol.
    Graph Representations: Use NetworkX to create and manipulate molecular graphs.
    Search Space Creation: Utilize the nablachem package to create and explore chemical search spaces.
